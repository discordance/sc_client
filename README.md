| `session_password`               | When using TCP, the session password must be the first command sent. The default is no password. UDP ports never require passwords, so if password protection is desired, use TCP.                                                                                                                                               |

| `input_streams_enable_string`    | Allows turning off input streams that you are not interested in on the device. If the string is 01100, for example, then only the second and third input streams on the device will be enabled. Turning off streams can reduce CPU load.                                                                                         |
| `output_streams_enable_string`   | Allows turning off output streams that you are not interested in on the device. If the string is 11000, for example, then only the first two output streams on the device will be enabled. Turning off streams can reduce CPU load.                                                                                              |
